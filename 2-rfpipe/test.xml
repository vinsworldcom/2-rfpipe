2-node with RFPipe model.

Start with:

  start_demo.sh root 2-rfpipe/ --runtostep run --policy autoadd

Once the scenario is started, use the following command to see when 
positions are injected as the first events.  You may need to run the command
multiple times until the positions populate (typically 30 seconds after the
`start_demo.sh ...` command finishes):

  emanesh node-1 get table 1 phy LocationEventInfoTable

Connect to node-1 and start a ping to node-2 over the RF-Pipe emulated link:

  ssh node-1
  ping 10.100.0.2

When finished, exit from the node-1 SSH session to the prompt.

  stop_demo.sh

Log files are stored in /tmp/etce/data/etcedemo-2-rfpipe-YYYYMMDDThhmmss/data.
Cleanup the log files after inspection:

  rm -rf /tmp/etce
